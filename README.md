<h1>Links</h1>
<h2>target</h2>

Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context (a tab, window, or <iframe>).
  
  The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:
  <ul>
  
<li>_self: the current browsing context. (Default)</li>
<li>_blank: usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.</li>
<li>_parent: the parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as _self.</li>
<li>_top: the topmost browsing context (the "highest" context thatâ€™s an ancestor of the current one). If no ancestors, behaves as _self.</li>
